Your friend, %%inviter_name%%, who attends the Jewish Men’s Retreat has suggested that you might enjoy joining him at our retreat this year.

The Jewish Men’s Retreat (JMR) takes place at the height of fall foliage, October 19-21, 2018, at Hazon’s Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center in bucolic Falls Village, CT. This is the 27th edition of JMR and is sponsored by the independent non-profit Menschwork.

The participants represent a diverse cross-section of Judaism, from cultural, to renewal, to reform, to conservative to orthodox. We will gather in community as loving brothers, immersed in nature’s beauty, we will deepen our connections with Jewish tradition and each other. We davven dynamically, study, contemplate, converse, eat, laugh, sing, dance, hike and simply chill.

Thematically, using the torah portion, Lech Lecha, as a guide, we’ll have a chance in small groups to share views of what it means to “Man UP!” and “Mensch UP!” – and explore how words like compassion, integrity, and spirit can inspire and support our personal journeys to becoming mensches.
